Kidney Tumour Classification Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the code and results for classifying kidney tumors using various machine learning algorithms on the Kidney Tumour Segmentation Challenge (KITS 23) dataset.

Dataset
The KITS 23 dataset originally had an uneven distribution of malignant cases. To address this, we applied the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset, achieving equal representation of classes.

Classifiers Evaluated
We assessed the performance of six classifiers on the balanced dataset:

Random Forest
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
Decision Tree
Naive Bayes
Results
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of balancing techniques and highlight the performance variations across different classifiers in medical image analysis. The balanced dataset and the evaluation metrics underscore the importance of data preprocessing in achieving reliable and accurate classification outcomes.

Conclusion
Balancing the dataset using SMOTE significantly improved the classification performance. The evaluation of various classifiers provides insights into their strengths and weaknesses in the context of medical image analysis.

I thank the KITS 23 Challenge organizers for providing the dataset and resources.
